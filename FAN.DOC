CREDITS
=======

I would like to thank Ramon van der Winkel, the author of WaterGate, for
providing me with his .DIF processing and generating system, without charge.
This has made providing bugfixes a LOT easier, and a lot smaller.

============
INTRODUCTION
============

TgFan is a utility for Telegard bulletin boards, which allows the SysOp
to post new file announcements in their message areas.  To the best of
my knowledge, there is no such other utility around.

TgFan remembers when it last ran by storing the date in a file named
TGFAN.LSD.

=========
UPGRADING
=========

You should read ADDENDUM.TXT before upgrading to any of the newer versions.

TgFan is updated via .DIF files.  You must apply these .DIF files in the
proper order (i.e. upgrading from TgFan 1.0 to 1.0p1, 1.0p2, etc.)  You
do this by unpacking the archive into your TgFan directory and typing:

UNDIF *

You can delete the .DIF files afterwards if the patch is successful.

===================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

TgFan is not resource heavy:

   *  MS-DOS, PC-DOS, OS/2, Windows, Windows 95, or Windows NT.
   *  256k of RAM
   *  150k of disk space (approx.)
   *  Telegard 3.09-compatible system

TgFan will probably run on a floppy disk, but I don't know why you'd want
to do that...

============================
INSTALLATION / CONFIGURATION
============================

Simply decompress the distribution archive into a directory of your choice
and modify FAN.CFG to suit your system.  There are enough comments in there,
that no explanation in this document should be necassary.

Then run FAN -R to reset the "last scan date".  If you don't do this, you
will get a very large posting of ALL the files on your system.

=====
USAGE
=====

TgFan should be run only ONCE per day.  Although it will normally be OK to
run it more often, you should make sure it is not run less than 4 hours
after the last run.  (It may miss some files if you do - this is not a
TgFan problem, as far as I can see, but something to do with the way that
Tim Strike calculates date/time, and the way the C++ API calculates them.)

Before you run TgFan, also run TELEGARD -FS to sort the file areas.
Otherwise, the file listings will be in whatever order they were added to
the file base.
